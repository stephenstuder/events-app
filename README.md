## about this project
This project was created using lessons and tutorials from Vue Mastery. It covers core vue concepts such as componenets, routing, vuex, and api calls with axios. It attempts to use best standards for Vue. 

## updates
I will continue to add to this as I go through the Vue mastery catalog of courses. Some needed features include a UI update, authorization and ability to have different users. A real backend and database. Sign up to events. Email confirmation. Possibly a back office role that could clear events and perform other tasks.
