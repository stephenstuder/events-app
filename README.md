## About this project

The foundation of this application is based off of some tutorials from Vue Mastery. I have additionaly added Jest for unit testing. In the near term I plan convert the styling to tailwind. Some long term goals would be to move to a real backend, add animations for a more user friendly experience, and add in a map api to show locations of each individual event.
