Rather than passing down as props and up as events, vuex provides state management that allows for the entire application to stay in sync as different components make changes. A single source of truth. 

The categories of vuex include state, mutations, actions, and getters

mapState is a cleaner syntax for bringing in multiple vuex state items. Using the spread operater you can mapState as a computed property and still be able to create other computed properties.
